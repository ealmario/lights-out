# Lights Out Game

Lights Out game activity for Colt Steele's React Bootcamp.

## About the Game

The aim of the game is to turn off all the lights on the board with the least number of clicks.

There are 3 board configurations: 3x3, 5x5, 7x7. Not all configuarations are solvable (sorry :sweat:) but would definitely work on that.
